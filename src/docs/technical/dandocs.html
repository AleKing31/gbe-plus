	<p class="gray_title">About Dan Docs</p>

	<p>For the longest time, a technical document called Pan Docs formed the basis of nearly all known documentation about the Nintendo Game Boy. To this day, Pan Docs (or an updated version such as the GBDev wiki) continues to be the go-to source of general Game Boy information. However, while Pan Docs covers the basics well enough, it does not touch upon more obscure Game Boy hardware. Dan Docs, on the other hand, aims to fill this gap. Dan Docs is basically everything else you wanted to know about the Game Boy, but no one dared to ask.</p>

	<p>All of the data here comes from my research for the GBE+ project. Much of this information is copied+pasted from the text files I&#39;ve made over the years. For ease of use and access, however, it&#39;s been converted to a single HTML document. As more items are reverse-engineered and studied, they will be added to Dan Docs as well as GBE+.</p>

	<!-- Barcode Boy -->

	<a name="bcb_gen"></a>
	<p class="gray_title">General Hardware Information - [BCB]</p>

	<p>Appearing around 1992, the Barcode Boy is the earliest form of card-scanning on Nintendo&#39;s Game Boy line of handhelds, predating both the e-Reader and the Bardigun Taisen Reader by a number of years. Only a limited set of games made by Namcot were compatible with (or rather absolutely required) the Barcode Boy. All of the games and the Barcode Boy itself were only released in Japan.</p>

	<ul>
		<li class="list_item">Barcode Boy is a rather bulky add-on that snaps on top of the original DMG (the gray &#34;brick&#34;)</li>
		<li class="list_item">Barcode Boy requires 2 AA batteries (with a DMG-01, that brings the total to 6 AA necessary to play any Barcode Boy game)</li>
		<li class="list_item">Barcode Boy WILL NOT WORK WITH OTHER GAME BOYS! For whatever reason using the Universal Link Cable (MGB-010) will not work.</li>
		<li class="list_item">Barcode Boy games are always labeled with a &#34;B.B.&#34; logo with a little card. Apparently there are 2 types (no idea what the Red/Blue differences are)</li>
		<li class="list_item">Includes a very, very short Link Cable</li>
		<li class="list_item">Unlike the Barcode Taisen Bardigun reader, the Barcode Boy has no button. It is always &#34;ON&#34; when switched on, thus draining batteries even while not scanning</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="gray_title">Barcode Boy Games</p>

	<p>Only 5 Barcode Boy games are known to exist:</p>

		<li class="list_item">Monster Maker Barcode Saga</li>
		<li class="list_item">Kattobi Road</li>

	<p class="gray_title">Barcode Boy to DMG Communication</p>

	<p>Each game will first try to detect if the Barcode Boy is plugged in and turned on. The Game Boy will send the bytes [0x10, 0x07, 0x10, 0x07] as part of a handshake. A properly functioning Barcode Boy will return the bytes [0xFF, 0xFF, 0x10, 0x07]. Barcode Boy games will still successfully detect the Barcode Boy scanner even if the first two bytes in the reply to the handshake aren't 0xFF, probably to simplify the game code. As a result, the first two bytes of the handshake are useless and ignored, but the last two bytes *MUST* be [0x10, 0x07]. If the Barcode Boy is plugged in but not turned on, it responds with 0x00 for the entire handshake, and the game produces an error message.</p>

	<p>After detection passes, the Game Boy will sit and wait for a response. The Game Boy, unlike how it works with other SIO devices, takes on a passive role with the Barcode Boy by switching to an external clock. The Game Boy actually requires the Barcode Boy to take the initiative when scanning. Therefore, it is assumed that the Barcode Boy uses an internal clock and drives serial communications while scanning a barcode.</p>

	<p>Nitty-gritty bits:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>The game logic pings the Barcode Boy with [0x10, 0x07, 0x10, 0x07]. The Barcode Boy is expected to reply; the first two bytes are not important (real hardware returns 0xFF), but the second two bytes must be [0x10, 0x07].</li>
		<li>Afterwards, the Game Boy waits for input using an external clock. What follows are two strings of numbers representing the barcode data. The &#34;numbers&#34; are represented as ASCII instead of hex.</li>
		<li>Both strings are 13-digits long and are the EAN-13 number corresponding to the barcode.</li>
		<li>Before sending each string, the Barcode Boy sends a 0x02 byte.</li>
		<li>After sending each string, the Barcode Boy sends a 0x03 byte.</li>
		<li>Altogether, the Barcode Boy transmits 30 bytes to the Game Boy.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Overall known communication protocol:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Handshake -&gt; Send [0x10, 0x07, 0x10, 0x07] : Receive [0xFF, 0xFF, 0x10, 0x07]</li>
		<li>Start Barcode Data Transmission -&gt; [0x02]</li>
		<li>Stop Barcode Data Transmission -&gt; [0x03]</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Standard communication flow:</p>

<code>[DMG]			[BCB]
Handshake	--->
		<---	Handshake

		<---	0x2
		<---	EAN-13
		<---	0x3

		<---	0x2
		<---	EAN-13
		<---	0x3</code>

	<p>Since the Barcode Boy acts as master (after the handshake at least), the Game Boy never initiates a transfer during barcode transmission. When sending barcode data, the Barcode Boy doesn&#39;t seem to care what value the Game Boy writes to SB, although no Barcode Boy games write to SB at that time anyway. Ultimately unknown if the Barcode Boy accepts input beyond the handshake, but no evidence has been observed to suggest otherwise.</p>

	<p>Once the Barcode Boy sends the handshake [0x10, 0x07] back to the Game Boy, the scanner returns 0xFF anytime the Game Boy tries to send additional data while the handheld is still on its own internal clock. After the Barcode Boy finishes sending back the barcode data to the Game Boy, it requires the handshake again. It appears the handshake can fail for unknown reasons (probably related to the hardware). For example, the Barcode Boy at times may send back [0x90, 0x07], which seems to indicate an error of some sort.</p>

	<a name="bcb_bar"></a>
	<p class="gray_title">Barcode Format</p>

	<p>The two strings are the actual barcode data in numerical form. The barcode format itself is EAN-13, and a few games use JAN-13 specifically. Older JAN-13 barcodes start off with the flag code 49. Interestingly enough, the newer JAN-13 flag code is 45 and was introduced in 1992, the same year the Barcode Boy was released. Probably due to timing or convenience, the JAN-13 barcodes on the cards stuck to the older flag code. Some Barcode Boy barcodes are technically &#34;coupons&#47;vouchers&#34; types, as they use the flag code 99 instead of 45 or 49. Family Jockey 2 and Famista 3 don't use JAN-13 specifically; instead they use random EAN-13 barcodes with varying flag codes.</p>

	<p>Using scans of the barcode @ 600 DPI, the smallest bar width is approximately 7 pixels (give or take). With that information, it&#39;s possible to recreate the EAN-13 number with a sufficient image and barcode scanning software. It should be noted that the Barcode Boy appears to do away with the center guard, however, it maintains left and right guards.</p>

	<a name="bcb_rip"></a>
	<p class="gray_title">Card Dumping + Emulation</p>

	<p>Amazingly simple in comparison to something like Barcode Taisen Bardigun, chiefly because such a small amount of bytes need to be sent to the Game Boy. Basically, all you need to do is convert the barcode to EAN-13. Anything capable of reading standard barcodes found on most products should be sufficient to grab the numerical form of each card.</p>

	<p>As far as emulation goes, simply convert the EAN-13 ASCII string to hex and transmit it accordingly.</p>

	<a name="bcb_err"></a>
	<p class="gray_title">Barcode Errors</p>

	<p>Interestingly enough, a vast majority of the barcodes for Family Jockey 2 are completely incorrect. Only 3 out of the 8 barcodes actually generate horses with the stats listed on the cards. Barcodes A1, B1, and A4 work fine; the rest give stats that do not match up with the card's. Some, such as A2, even generate horses that are totally unfit for competition (A2 produces stats with 2s and 0s, and the max is supposed to be 9 in each category). It's not clear if this was a programming glitch or a mistake Namcot made when printing the cards, or some combination of the two. All other Barcode Boy games came packaged with cards that have no issues whatsoever.</p>


	<!-- Barcode Taisen Bardigun -->

	<a name="btb_gen"></a>
	<p class="gray_title">General Hardware Information - [BTB]</p>

	<p>Barcode Taisen Bardigun is a Japanese Game Boy game released December 11, 1998, made by TAM. It doesn&#39;t seem like a very interesting or noteworthy game in and of itself (yet another monster breeding&#47;raising&#47;fighting&#47;collecting game). However, this game featured exclusive hardware, a card reader that scanned various barcodes</p>

	<ul>
		<li class="list_item">Barcode Taisen Bardigun (DMG-ABEJ-JPN)</li>
		<li class="list_item">MBC3 + RTC + Battery Saves (Same as Pokemon Gold and Silver)</li>
		<li class="list_item">Compatible with DMG, SGB, and GBC systems</li>
		<li class="list_item">Japanese-text only (hiragana&#47;katakana only, a bit of a blessing given 8x8 fonts are not the best for kanji)</li>
		<li class="list_item">Supports Link Cable for multiplayer</li>
		<li class="list_item">Comes with 1 card-reader powered by 3 AAA batteries</li>
		<li class="list_item">Comes with 5 cards bundled (only 3 have barcodes, the other 2 are just collectables?)</li>
		<li class="list_item">Reader connects to DMG/GBC serial port for communication</li>
	</ul>

	<a name="btb_com"></a>
	<p class="gray_title">Card Reader to GBC Communication</p>

	<p>Game Boy will initialize a transfer with an internal clock; much like every other Serial I/O device (GB Printer, GB Mobile Adapter), Game Boy sends initial data, then the reader responds. Transfer rate is 1KB&#47;s, the slowest speed, so there is no difference between DMG and GBC transfers. To begin, the Game Boy constantly sends 0xFF to the reader. The game logic times out after a few seconds if no proper response is established.</p>

	<p>To scan a card, hold it face down (barcode facing the ground and towards the reader), press the reader&#39;s button, and swipe. The scanner only seems to activate once the button is pushed (otherwise it&#39;d waste battery if it were constantly on, or constantly on and trying to receieve commands from the Game Boy). Without pressing the button, the game logic times out the scanning process after a few seconds (about 9 seconds). If an error is detected during the scan process, the reader seems to acknowledge this pretty quickly.</p>

	<p>Nitty-gritty bits</p>

	<ol>
		<li>When connected, the reader responds with 0x00 until it is prepared to send the barcode data.</li>

		<li>Afterwards, it begins processing barcode data. Data is represented serially. A bit reading &#34;1&#34; indicates that the card reader is detecting whitespace. A bit reading &#34;0&#34; indicates the card reader is detecting a black segment (black bar).</li>

		<li>The barcode sequence itself is nothing more than a continuous stream of zeroes and ones. That is to say, groups of ones and zeroes are always packed together, but the length of each group determines the length of any given bar.</li>

		<li>There doesn&#39;t appear to be a fixed number of bytes that the Game Boy seems to expect when scanning. Different scans seem to produce different amounts of data transferred to the Game Boy. This could be due to numerous reasons in the hardware (swipe speed, how clean the scanner is, some other variance within the scanner's light sensitivity). Overall, however, the most important thing seems to be the length and sequence of the bars encoded as groups of ones and zeroes.</li>

		<li>The Game Boy doesn&#39;t ever seem to send any interesting data, just 0xFF. No commands are sent. The Game Boy simply sends a byte and expects a result to come from the reader; the results are what matter and are interpreted later on.</li>

	</ol>

	<a name="btb_bar"></a>
	<p class="gray_title">Barcode Format</p>

	<p>Because the incoming barcode data is not consistent byte-for-byte, the patterns are what matters most. To illustrate this idea, below are two sets of data extracted after scanning a card (using a hacked version of Barcode Taisen Bardigun and saving all SIO communications to Cart RAM).</p>

<code>SET_1		SET_2
00 00		00 03		
7F FE		FF F8
00 01		00 03
FF FF 		FF FF
FF FF		FF FF
FF C0		FF E0
00 3F		00 0F
FF 00		FF 80
00 00		00 00
07 FF		00 FF
00 00		FC 00
FF FF		03 FF
FF C0		FF FF
00 00		C0 00</code>

<p>Each set is actually a bitstream of 0s and 1s like so:</p>

<code>Set 1 [16:0] [14:1] [15:0] [43:1] ...
Set 2 [14:0] [15:1] [14:0] [45:1] ...</code>

	<p>The patterns in the sets are roughly the same. They switch between 0s, 1s, and 0s (black, white, black) fairly quickly followed by a long segment of 1s (white) which is roughly the general pattern seen at the beginning&#47;ends of the barcodes. Based on this information, the thinest bars are about 0.0133 inches (8 pixels when scanning at 600dpi). Some further calculations based on this information:</p>

<code>Bar Width (in pixels @ 600dpi) -&gt; Estimated bit-count sent to Game Boy

8	-&gt;	~14-16
16	-&gt;	~27-29
24	-&gt;	~43-45</code>

	<p>Every 8 pixels should be approximately 15 bits worth of data sent to the Game Boy, so:</p>

	<code>Number of Pixels @ 600dpi * 1.875 = Approximate bit count</code>

	<a name="btb_rip"></a>
	<p class="gray_title">Card Dumping</p>

	<p>With the above guideline, it is possible to dump the cards by scanning them, then creating a binary file containing barcodes as alternating bitstreams of 0s and 1s. With this method, no homebrew techniques are needed, and only an image file is necessary to actually preserve the card.</p>

	<p>The second method involves using a hacked version of the Barcode Taisen Bardigun ROM on a flashcart to save incoming Serial I&#47;O data as a card is scanned. The binary can be pulled from a save file. Both binary files could be used an input to feed back to an emulator.</p>
